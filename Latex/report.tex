    \subsection{Load Time Series}
    This time series was designed by deciding with the idea that the power is being sent to a residential area.  The usage would be low in the middle
    of the night and high when residents are home from work.  It would gradually
    increase/decrease throughout the other parts of the day.  The assumption
    is that a week days are being explored.

    To find the values, a range was given for each hour through out the day.
    A value for each hour within these ranges is randomly selected.  A set
    number of days can be produced.  In order to smooth out the curve an additional parameter was utilized to combine a set of days into a group and take the mean.  The purpose of this is to smooth out the curve into something that would look more realistic.

    \subsection{Source Chromosome Format}
    The chromosome format for each source is
    \[[power, cost, emission]\]

    The gene boundaries are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(15W \leq power \leq 120W\)
        \item \(\$.01 \leq cost \leq \$.2\)
        \item \(.01 tons \leq emission \leq .04 tons\)
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Fitness Optimization}
    Economic optimization means that lower cost is better.  If the requirements can be met with lower cost this would be a beneficial economic adjustment.

    Economic boundary for fitness function:
    \textbf{TODO}
    \newline 

    Environmental optimization would imply that less emissions produced would be better for the environment.

    Environmental boundary for fitness function:
    \textbf{TODO}
    \newline 

    Another optimization that is required is the amount of power is delivered.  If there is not enough power being delivered then outages will occur.
    \textbf{TODO}

    \subsection{Defined Constants}
